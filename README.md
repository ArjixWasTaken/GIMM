# Genshin Impact Mod Manager

This is still under development, so beware

The goal of this project is to easily manage character skins in <a href="https://github.com/SilentNightSound/GI-Model-Importer">[GIMI]</a>
choose a folder that has all your character skins, and the mod folder inside GIMI

Please make sure all the mods you currently have inside GIMI are also in your mod folder, this tool will delete folders from the gimi mod folder when setting new mods to active
